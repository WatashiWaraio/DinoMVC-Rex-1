**ABOUT DinoMVC-Rex**

"This project is a university assignment for the Fundamentals of Software Design course(POO). Within this subject, we explore MVC architecture, UML design, and various methodologies for effective software development.
Our instructor primarily focuses on guiding us through creating well-structured software designs. I'll be collaborating on this project with my partners."

Our goal is to develop a basic software application for Knowledge Management System (KMS), a critical tool for effective knowledge management within organizations, such as a laundry service.
Initially, this project will encompass three core functions. We aim to expand its functionalities in the future. The initial functions include an admin user interface allowing actions like adding, deleting, modifying, and searching users. 
The second function involves accessing tutorials on laundry-related tasks like washing a jacket, along with managing tutorial information. Additionally, the software will incorporate a login feature.

I want to emphasize that this is a very basic project ( We used horrible graphical interfaces because the nice ones weren't compatible with our IDE.). If you require a guide for your university assignment on MVC structure or POO. 
We'll be excited if our work can help guide you, even just a little bit.ðŸ¤ª

The software architecture follows a fundamental MVC model. If you're unfamiliar with MVC architecture, I'd be happy to provide a brief explanation."

**WHAT IS MVC ARCHITECTURE?**

comprehending different software architectures can be a bit confusing initially. MVC, short for Model-View-Controller, serves as a fundamental architectural pattern in software development. 
It divides an application's logic into three interconnected components: the model (responsible for data handling and business logic), the view (displaying data to users), and the controller (managing user input and updating the model). 
Trygve Teenskaug is the creator of MVC, he wanted to search a pattern that could be used to structure any promag where users interact with a large. Before diving into software development, employing systems thinking is crucial to establish the requirements.
It's impossible to create software without a clear idea of its requirements. Having a comprehensive understanding of what the software needs to achieve is fundamental before initiating the development process. 
This ensures that the software aligns with the intended purpose and meets the necessary criteria for success.

**What did we do at DINOMVC-Rex ?**

Initially, we gather requirements for our software, which involves creating various documents and analyses. However, I'm pretty sure you're not too keen on documents.
So, we move on to defining a UML design for our project. Models are located within the DinoMVC-MODEL section. If you'd like a better understanding of our code, please take a look there.

If you want to see the program in action, head to the latest release on this repository and follow the provided instructions.

**WELL DONE**
Big thanks to my partner Emanuel; he taught me GitHub and put in a lot of work on this project. He's a real genius, JAJAJ.
Shoutout to my partner Sofia for handling the page transitions like a boss.
And a huge thanks to my partner Johan; he gave a quick rundown on POO and nailed HER OBJECTIVE with me (KAREN NEEDS TO LEARN). He gathered requirements for our software.

Felipe and Laura, thank you for your help. Thanks, engineers.
